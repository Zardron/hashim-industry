          In 1963, when the Hashim Group commenced its inaugural journey,
          skepticism abounded. However, through the determination of its
          founder, bolstered by the support of well-wishers and guided by divine
          providence, the group has overcome myriad challenges to emerge as a
          distinguished entity in the global plastics converting industry. The
          path has been arduous, yet today, the group stands poised to continue
          its legacy of success, carrying forward the torch of sustainable and
          environmentally conscious plastics for the future.

          With Saudi Arabia emerging as a hotbed for real estate investments,
          attracting a wave of builders and real estate developers from around
          the globe, the demand for construction and sanitary pipes skyrocketed.
          Rising to meet this challenge, our group embraced this challenge
          head-on. Our group ventured into the construction market with the
          establishment of GM in the 6th of October City. Since then, we have
          set the benchmark for excellence with our state-of-the-art products.
          Looking ahead, we are committed to furthering our presence in this
          industry, ready to address the ever-growing global need for
          high-quality water, gas, and sewage piping solutions.
