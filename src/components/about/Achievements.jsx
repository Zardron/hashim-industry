          When the Hashem Group started its first operations in 1963, some had
          their doubts, but the founder, with the help of his well-wishers and
          grace of the almighty have overcome all challenges and established
          itself as a reputed name in the international plastics converting
          industry. It has not been the easiest of tasks, but the group today is
          strongly poised to extend it success story and lead the baton of
          sustainable and eco-friendly plastics in the years to come.

          In order to meet the demands of some of the biggest companies in the
          world, we had to revamp and realign our process several times, and we
          have succeeded in standing up to the occasion every time. Today, we
          are in over 43 country and our strong workforce of 2300 talented
          employees work hard to maintain our high standards of products and
          services, as well as to secure a steady and reliable supply of
          plastics.

          International investments in Saudi Arabia in the real estate segment
          made it one of the busiest places in the Middle East for builders and
          real estate magnates. The burgeoning demands for construction and
          sanitary pipes had to be met and we were ready to take up that
          challenge. With the inception of GM in the 6th of October City, our
          group entered the construction market and today we have created a
          benchmark with our products. Furthermore, we hope to be actively
          involved in this industry and be ready to meet the ever increasing
          global need for water, gas and sewage pipes.

          In the view of many environmentalists, the production of plastics
          should be done in a manner that causes least harm to the environment.
          Hashem Group is deeply aware of its responsibility towards the
          environment and has taken concrete steps in order to develop a
          sustainable future. We invest generously on research related
          activities that are aimed at reducing plastics and reusing them
          sensibly. International laws and guidelines that govern the production
          and use of plastics has guided us in the matter and helped us stay
          close to our corporate goals of creating a sustainable future.
