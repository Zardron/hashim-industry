              The initial years were not a bed of roses. The group began as a
              company that made flipflops (footwear) and water cups for the
              pilgrim. As the group grew in size and capacity, it expanded the
              portfolio to other industries, notably industrial materials
              industry, and real estate. The group witnessed great success in
              these segments and began exporting plastics to European countries.

          Arabian Gulf Manufacturers Ltd was the first venture of the group that
          brought success to the company. The industry is spread over a
          sprawling 90,000 square meter of industrial area situated close to the
          centre of Jeddah, which is the second largest city in the kingdom and
          strategically placed near maritime channels running in and out of the
          Red Sea. Since its inception in 1963, Gulf Maid (AGM) is a company
          with worldwide operations with key business partners in Europe, Asia
          and Africa.

          but Hashim Industry management did not let the success deviate the
          initial dreams and they knew more had to be done in order to raise The
          Hashem Industry supremacy in advanced plastics in the region as well
          as worldwide.

          Subsequently, started another plastics manufacturing and packaging
          industry. Prime Plastic Products (3P) was established in the year
          1992, producing state-of-art packaging solutions capable of handling
          products like Food, Beverage and Water, Pharmaceutical, Dentifrice,
          Personal Care industries. Stretch & shrink wrapping. 3P was based on
          100,000 sq. m area in Jeddah adjacent to the existing AGM facility.
          Not only does the new industry adds a new feather to the group's hat,
          it also expands its territorially.

          After having admirably conquered the plastics and packaging industry,
          next in line was something that provided the group an avenue to
          increase its portfolio without wandering off its favorite industry,
          which was plastic manufacturing.

          The shrewd leader in Mr.Hashem saw the opportunity in the construction
          materials. The group had an immense experience in manufacturing
          plastics, so the transition was rather easy for it to make and the
          consequential profits were enormous. The pros of entering the HDPE
          pipes manufacturing industry outweighed the cons, so in the year 2000
          the all new Gulf Manufacturers (GM) began operations in Cairo/Egypt,
          and started manufacturing HDPE pipes. Gulf Manufacturers has an annual
          output of 72,000 Metric Tonnes.

              In the following years, Hashim Industry expanded the pipes
              portfolio to construction industry that was riding on huge wave of
              foreign investments in Saudi Arabia, and Egypt. Buoyed by strong
              demands from builders and construction workers, RAKtherm
              immediately became a big name not just in the immediate region,
              but also in the entire region. Every year 9000 metric tonnes of
              PP-R pipes roll out of RakTherm which is then shipped all over the
              region. With efficient administration, great workforce working in
              factories spread over 40,000 sqm., and its strategic position at
              Ras Al Khaimah, it was soon becoming clear that the company would
              soon become the one and only name in high quality constructions
              pipes.

          In the later years, the group began showing interest in real estate,
          communications, and then later high performance plastic solutions. To
          that end, Hashim Industry unveiled in 2012 a brand new venture to
          cater to the global market that needed high performance plastic
          solutions. Added-value plastic products are manufactured and made in
          cutting edge factory of TAHWEEL Industry in Ras Al Khaimah, UAE.

          that the founder had seen for the group.
